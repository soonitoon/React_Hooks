# useNotification
Javascript Function that sends browser message to the user.

## Notice
**useNotification** is in the repository "React_Hooks", but it is not React Hook!ðŸ™ƒ So it doesn't have any dependency modules.

## Installation
1. `$ npm install @sooni-hooks/use-notification`
2. Add `import useNotification from "@sooni-hooks/use-notification"` in your script.
3. Done!

## How to use
**useNotification** takes two arguments;
1. **title**: Message title.
2. **options**: An object containing custom setting.

The possible options are:

- **lang**: The notification's language, as specified using a DOMString representing a BCP 47 language tag. See the Sitepoint ISO 2 letter language codes page for a simple reference.
- **body**: A DOMString representing the body text of the notification, which is displayed below the title.
- **tag**: A DOMString representing an identifying tag for the notification.
- **icon**: A USVString containing the URL of an icon to be displayed in the notification.
- **image**: a USVString containing the URL of an image to be displayed in the notification.
- **data**: Arbitrary data that you want associated with the notification. This can be of any data type.
- **vibrate**: A vibration pattern for the device's vibration hardware to emit with the notification.
- **silent**: A Boolean specifying whether the notification is silent (no sounds or vibrations issued), regardless of the device settings. The default is false, which means it won't be silent.

`useNotification` returns `sandNotification()`. It sends a notification permission request to the user. It makes browser message if user agrees.
